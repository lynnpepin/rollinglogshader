A vertex-displacement shader performing the "rolling-log" effect from Animal Crossing, written for Godot 3.1.

I haven't finished this yet! I still want to...

1. Update normals properly.
2. Find an easy way to mix the vertex displacement with other materials.
3. Add a routine to rotate (but not skew) other models (such as a large light pole).
4. Clean it all up and add a license!
