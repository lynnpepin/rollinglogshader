A vertex-displacement shader performing the "rolling-log" effect from Animal Crossing, written for Godot 3.1.

I haven't finished this yet! I still want to...

1. Find an easy way to mix the vertex displacement with other materials.
2. Add a routine to rotate (but not skew) other models (such as a large light pole).
3. Make vertex displacement occur before all shading (so updated normals work properly.) 
4. Clean it all up and add a license!
