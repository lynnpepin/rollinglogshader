A vertex-displacement shader performing the "rolling-log" effect from Animal Crossing, written for Godot 3.1.

I haven't finished this yet! I still want to...

1. Update the math to use actual polar coordinates,
2. Add more detailed overworld to display the effect,
3. Find a way to properly rotate and translate models (without distorting them).
4. Clean it all up and add a license
