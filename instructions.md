Try
 - ShaderInclude
 - VisualShader
 - ???

Steps:

1. Simply use `rolling.gdshader`
2. Or, for `.gdshader`

Making levels:

1. The shader default player position is `0,0,0`. Try to keep this as the player origin.
2. While editing, keep the shader `Active` unchecked, for ease of editing.

TODOs:

1. Add descriptions to properties (if possible)
2. Fix Metallic (autogenerated code is wrong)
3. Find a way to Shader Include on normal shaders?

Fun ideas:

1. Set the radius as a function of player height or camera distance
